# SearchEngine
In my development life, I always end up doing some string-searching work in files, or even directories, to fix something or find a problem.
So, one day I decided to create a libary to help with that, and them I did! I prevent to you SearchEngine, a simple library to find patters inside a file or directory.

## Releases, please


## How to install

### Using NugetRepository
Has a better way to share code tham using a repository? I don't think so. Them you can find the SearchEngine in the Nuget and use it.
If you prefer the command line, here it's:

### Importing as .dll
You can download the release and import the SearchEngine.dll to your project. 

### Building by my own
Or, if you prefer, you can insert the file SearchEngine.cs inside your project and build it by your own. :)

## How this work?
Very simple, I must to tell you.
